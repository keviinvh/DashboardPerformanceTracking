# Personal Project, Data Tracking & Dashboard: Financial Tracking Tool  

This was a personal project I took on from a family member. He had been manually tracking his financials and wanted to be able to see his weekly and monthly summaries 
while at the same time tracking and inputting his income and expenses.

The categories for income and expenses were given to me by the family member, so that is what is displayed and those are the options.

I will break the project down step-by-step.

I knew there had to be separate sheets to track income and to track expenses so that is where I started.

Starting with the income sheet, I knew there needed to be columns for the date, amount, category, and notes to describe the purchase.
